A Movies App is a simple app that loads information from local JSON and Flickr Photo Image API to show an approach to using some of the best practices in Android Development. 
Including:  
 * ViewModel
 * LiveData
 * Hilt (for dependency injection)
 * Kotlin Coroutines
 * Kotlin Extension Functions
 * Retrofit 2.0
 * Glide 4.0
 * Okhttp3
 * Room is not used currently but will use in future to store the fetched data from Flickr
 * Navigation

 
All the dependencies are declared in the build.gradle file. No need to take some extra measure. 
Just import this project via Android Studio :)
